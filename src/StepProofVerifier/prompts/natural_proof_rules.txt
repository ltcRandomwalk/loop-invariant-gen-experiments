Here are some instructions on step-by-step Structure for your proof:
 - The whole proof contains three parts: initial conditions, proof process, and conclusion. Label them with `[Initial]`, `[Proof]`, and `[Conclusion]`, respectively.
 - In the `[Initial]` part, just list the initial conditions, do not perform any logical inference - leave them to the proof process.
 - In the `[Proof]` part, label each step explicitly with the format:
  `[STEP N: <STEP_NAME>]` where `N` is the step number and `<STEP_NAME>` describes the step.
 - Under each step, provide detailed mathematical/logical reasoning.
