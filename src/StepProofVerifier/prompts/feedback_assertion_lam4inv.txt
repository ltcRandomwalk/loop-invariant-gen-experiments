This indicates that the loop invariants you proposed are all correct, but they are not sufficient to verify the assertion {assertion}. 

Please fix your loop invariants in the following steps:
First, based on the error in your proof, analyze why the loop invariant are not sufficient to verify the assertion {assertion}.
Then, from your analysis, carefully think about the verification problem again. Every time you propose a loop invariant, note that do not make the same mistake again.

In the end, print loop invariants as valid C assertions that help prove the assertion. 
In order to get a correct answer, You may want to consider both the situation of not entering the loop and the situation of jumping out of the loop. 
If some of the preconditions are also loop invariant, you need to add them to your answer as well. 
Use '&&' or '||' if necessary. Your answer should follow the following format:

```c 
    assert(...);
    assert(...);
    ...
```
