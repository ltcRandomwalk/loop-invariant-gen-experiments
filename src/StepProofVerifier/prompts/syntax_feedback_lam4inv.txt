The loop invariants you proposed have some syntax errors. Please fix the syntax errors and propose the loop invariants again. Here are some typical rules that you should follow:
1. The loop invariant must be a legal C logical expression. It can contain "&&", "||", and "!". Do not use any natural language in the loop invariant.
2. You can only use variables that are declared in the original program. It cannot contain functions. 
3. Follow the output format exactly. Do not miss the above "```c" and the bottom "```" in your output.

Summarize the loop invariants in the following format in the end of your response. Do not explain.

```c 
    assert(...);
    assert(...);
    ...
```
