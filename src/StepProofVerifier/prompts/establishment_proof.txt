Please prove the establishment of the loop invariant {loop_invariant} step by step. That is, {loop_invariant} holds before the loop starts. 
Specifically, you should prove the following goal: P ==> I, where P is the pre-condition, and I is the loop invariant {loop_invariant}.
You should prove the goal in the following steps: First, list the initial conditions. In this case, the initial conditions are the program states before the loop. Note that, the loop condition should not be viewed as a condition. Second, prove that {loop_invariant} holds before the loop step by step.
