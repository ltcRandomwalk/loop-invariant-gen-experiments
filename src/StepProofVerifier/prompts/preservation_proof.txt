Please prove the preservation of the loop invariant {loop_invariant} step by step. That is, if all the loop invariants hold before the loop, then the loop invariant {loop_invariant} still holds after an iteration of the loop. 
Specifically, you should prove the following goal: {{I /\ B}} ==> I', where I in the pre-condition are the loop invariants you proposed (all invariants), B is the loop condition, and I' stands for the specific loop invariant {loop_invariant} holds for the new values.
You should prove the goal in the following steps: First, list the initial conditions. In this case, the initial conditions are the loop invariants you proposed (I), and the condition that enters the loop (B). Second, prove the above goal step by step. You may need to declare new variables for after-loop values. In this case, use C variable naming rules to define them (for example, a_new).
