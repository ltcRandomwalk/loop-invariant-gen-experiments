Please prove the preservation of the loop invariant {loop_invariant} step by step. That is, if all the loop invariants hold before the loop, then the loop invariant {loop_invariant} still holds after an iteration of the loop. You should prove the goal in the following steps: First, list the initial conditions. In this case, the initial conditions are the loop invariants you proposed, and the condition that enters the loop. Second, prove that if the initial conditions hold before the loop, then the loop invariant {loop_invariant} still holds after an interation of the loop step by step.
