Here is a C program, with some assertions to verify:

```c
{code}
```

To verify the assertion, here are the proposed loop invariants for the loop in the program:
```c
{invariant_block}
```

Here is a part of the proof:

{natural_proof}

Please read the above proof for one goal. For the step {step} in the above proof, formalize its logical content into first-order logic expressions. Follow these rules:

1. Focus only on {step}: Formalize **only** the step explicitly marked with {step}, and ignore other steps.
2. List the known conditions before this step. Each condition should be a logical expression represented in C grammar. The detailed known conditions are listed as follows:
    - The initial conditions.
    - The conclusions that derived from previous big steps.
    - If this step needs declare a new variable, list it here using "==" symbol.
3. Formalization requirements:
    - Convert natural language claims into precise first-order logic formulas.
    - For each formula, represent it as an implication, using "==>" to represent.
    - The condition and the conclusion of the implication should be legal C logical expressions, i.e. it can only contain "&&", "||" and "!" as logic operators.
    - Each formula should be self-contained so that it can be checked.
    - You do not need to verify the correctness of the proof, just formalize it in logic formulas.
    - At last, summarize the conclusion of this step using a C logical expression. **Here, the conclusion means the one that are actually derived from this step, not the one that need to be derived.**

Output format:
    - First, list the known conditions. This part begins with a `[Initial]` label, with one condition per line. Each condition should be a legal C logical expression.ã€€Each condition follows by a comment starting with "//". Follow the following rules for comments:
        1. If the condition comes from initial conditions, comment "initial".
        2. If the condition comes from conclusions derived by previous big steps, comment "derived".
        3. If the condition is a declaration of a new variable, comment "declaration".
        4. Comment a single word for each condition.
    - Then, output the formalized proof. This part begins with a `[Proof]` label, with one implication per line.
    - Output one implication in each line, following by a comment starting with "//" which matches the claim in the natural language proof. The condition and conclusion must be legal C logical expressions. For example: 
      ```
      (a <= 0) && (a == m) ==> (m <= 0) // From a is non-positive, and a is equal to m, we know that m is non-positive, too.
      ```
    - At last, output the conclusion of this step. This part begins with a `[Conclusion]` label. The conclusion stays within one line, with exactly one C logical expression. Similar to the above, represent the explanation to the conclusion in a comment starting with "//".
    - Only output the conditions, implications, conclusions,  and comments, do not explain.
    - For all C logical expressions mentioned above, do not use functions in it.
