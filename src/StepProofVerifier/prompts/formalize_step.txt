Here is a C program, with some assertions to verify:

```c
{code}
```

To verify the assertion, here are the proposed loop invariants for the loop in the program:
```c
{invariant_block}
```

Here is a part of the proof:

{natural_proof}

Please read the above proof for one goal. For the step {step} in the above proof, formalize its logical content into first-order logic expressions. Follow these rules:

1. Focus only on {step}: Formalize **only** the step explicitly marked with {step}, and ignore other steps.
2. List the known conditions before this step. The conditions include the initial conditions of the whole proof, and the conclusions that are derived from previous big steps.
3. Formalization requirements:
    - Convert natural language claims into precise first-order logic formulas.
    - For each formula, represent it as an implication, using "==>" to represent.
    - If a conclusion is derived from the program semantics, then just list "true" as the condition.
    - The condition and the conclusion of the implication should be legal C logical expressions, i.e. it can only contain "&&", "||" and "!" as logic symbols.
    - Each formula should be self-contained so that it can be checked.
    - You do not need to verify the correctness of the proof, just formalize it in logic formulas.
4. Output format:
    - First, list the known conditions. This part begins with a `[Initial]` label, with one condition per line. Each condition should be a legal C logical expression.
    - Then, output the formalized proof. This part begins with a `[Proof]` label, with one implication per line.
    - Output one implication in each line, following by a comment starting with "//" which matches the claim in the natural language proof. For example: 
      ```
      (a <= 0) && (a == m) ==> (m <= 0) // From a is non-positive, and a is equal to m, we know that m is non-positive, too.
      ```
    - Only output the conditions, implications, and comments, do not explain.
