This indicates that the loop invariant {invariant} is actually not preserved. **That is, if all the loop invariants hold before the loop, {invariant} does not hold after an iteration of the loop.**

Please fix your loop invariants in the following steps:
First, based on the error in your proof, analyze why the loop invariant {invariant} is not preserved.
Then, from your analysis, carefully think about the verification problem again. Every time you propose a loop invariant, note that do not make the same mistake again.

Each loop invariant should be a C logical expression, which can contain "&&" and "||". Do not use variables or functions that are not declared in the program. Summarize the fixed loop invariants in the following format in the end of your response:

```c 
/*@ 
    loop invariant i1: ...;
    loop invariant i2: ...;
    ...
*/
