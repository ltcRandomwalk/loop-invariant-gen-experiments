    Please analyze the above C code and verify the assertions in it. 
    In order to verify the assertion, you need to propose loop invariants for the loop in the program. A loop invariant is a property that holds **before the loop**, and **after each iteration of the loop**. Besides, the loop invariants should be helpful to verify the assertion.
    
    In your previous answer, the loop invariants you proposed are:
    /*@
    loop invariant i1: i >= 1 && i <= n + 1;
    loop invariant i2: sn == (i - 1) * 2;
*/
    
    The establishment of the loop invariant i >= 1 && i <= n + 1 cannot be verified. In order to help you correct the mistake, I will ask you to give a proof of the establishment of this loop invariant i >= 1 && i <= n + 1.
    
    In particular, you should prove that the loop invariant holds before the loop. You should fisrt list the known conditions, and from the conditions, prove that the loop invariant holds before the loop step by step.
    The conditions in this case are the program states before the loop. Note that, if a variable is not initialized, you should not make any assumption on it.
    
    You should first prove the goal in natural language, and then formalize the key steps of your proof with a json file. The format of the json file is as follow. For the blank <Proof Goal>, briefly summary the proof goal in natural language.  For each implication, represent it in the format "c1 ==> c2". c1 and c2 should be pure C logical expressions, without any natural languange in it. c1 can derive c2 without any other conditions.
    ```json
    {
        "Step 1: <Proof Goal>": ["c1 ==> c2", "c1 ==> c2", ...]
        "Step 2: <Proof Goal>": ["c1 ==> c2", "c1 ==> c2", ...]
        ...
    }
    ```
    
    
    
### Proof in Natural Language:  
We aim to prove that the loop invariant `i >= 1 && i <= n + 1` holds **before the loop** starts. To accomplish this, we consider the state of the program just before the loop begins.

Known conditions just before the loop (`for (i = 1; i <= n; i++)`):  
1) Variable `i` is explicitly initialized with the value `1` before the loop begins.  
2) No explicit constraints are imposed on `i` before the loop starts apart from its initialization (`i = 1`).  
3) `n` has already been assigned a value by the result of `unknown_int()`. However, the condition `assume(n < 1000 && n >= -1000)` ensures that `n` is bounded such that `-1000 ≤ n < 1000`.  

We determine whether the invariant `i >= 1 && i <= n + 1` holds **before the loop**:  

- Since `i` is initialized to `1`, it is inherently true that `i >= 1` at the start of the loop.  
- The condition `i <= n + 1` needs further reasoning. Given that `i = 1`, and assuming `n` satisfies the provided bounds, the expression `1 <= n + 1` always holds for the following reasons: if `n >= -1000`, then `1 <= n + 1` must be true.  

### JSON Representation of Key Steps:
```json
{
    "Step 1: Prove that i >= 1": [
        "i is initialized as 1 ==> i >= 1"
    ],
    "Step 2: Prove that i <= n + 1 before entering the loop": [
        "i is initialized as 1 ==> i <= n + 1"
    ],
    "Step 3: Combine to establish i >= 1 && i <= n + 1": [
        "i >= 1 && i <= n + 1 ==> i >= 1 && i <= n + 1"
    ]
}
```

### Explanation of Each Step:
1. **Step 1: Prove `i >= 1`:**
    - Before the loop, `i` is initialized to `1`. By direct substitution, it follows that `i >= 1`. This part of the invariant is established.  

2. **Step 2: Prove `i <= n + 1`:**
    - At the start of the loop, `i` is also initialized to `1`. By the condition `assume(n < 1000 && n >= -1000)`, we know `n + 1` must also lie within valid bounds because `n` is finite. Given `n >= -1000`, it follows that `1 ≤ n + 1`. Hence, `i = 1` satisfies `i <= n + 1`.

3. **Step 3: Combine to establish the invariant `i >= 1 && i <= n + 1`:**
    - Both parts, `i >= 1` and `i <= n + 1`, are satisfied independently. Combining these facts proves that `i >= 1 && i <= n + 1` holds before the loop begins.
