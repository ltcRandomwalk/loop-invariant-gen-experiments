Please prove the preservation of the loop invariant i == 0 || (i > 0 && i < 2*k). If the loop invariants i1, i2 hold before the loop, then after an iteration of the loop, the loop invariant  i == 0 || (i > 0 && i < 2*k) still holds. You should prove the goal in the following step:
1. List initial conditions. In this task, the initial conditions are the loop invariants i1, i2, and the condition that enters the loop i < 2 * k. You can only use these conditions to complete the proof.
2. Analyze the new value of the variables that after an iteration of the loop. You can use {v}_new to declare the new value. For example, use x_new to represent the new value of x.
3. Prove that the loop invariant i == 0 || (i > 0 && i < 2*k) holds for the new values.
4. Prove the goal step by step. You can split the whole proof into a sequence of proof goals. For each proof goal, first briefly introduce the goal, and then prove it step by step.
5. You can split a proof goal into cases. For each case, first introduce the case condition, then prove the goal step by step.
6. Proof goals and cases can be recursive. That is, for your convenience, you can split a goal or case into subgoals or subcases.
7. For each proof goal or case, prove the goal in detail.
8. Last, output the conclusion.
