Consider the following C program and the assertions:

```c
#include <stdlib.h>
#define assume(e) if(!(e)) exit(-1);
extern int unknown(void);

int main()
{
    int z1,z2,z3;
    int x = 0;
    int m = 0;
    int n;

    while (x < n) {
        if (unknown()) {
            m = x;
        }
        x = x + 1;
    }

    if(n > 0) {
       
       {;
//@ assert(m >= 0);
}

    }
}
```
   
Consider the following loop invariants for the loop in the program: 

/*@
  loop invariant i1: ...;
  loop invariant i2: ...;
*/


Please prove the establishment of the loop invariant (x == 0 ==> (y > 0 ==> x > 0) && (y <= 0 ==> x < 0)) . That is, (x == 0 ==> (y > 0 ==> x > 0) && (y <= 0 ==> x < 0))  holds before the loop. You should prove this goal in the following steps:
1. First, list the initial conditions. In this case, the known conditions are: x * y >= 0. The proof goal is: (x == 0 ==> (y > 0 ==> x > 0) && (y <= 0 ==> x < 0)) holds before the loop.
2. Prove the goal step by step. You can split the whol proof into a sequence of proof goals. For each proof goal, first briefly introduce the goal, and then prove it step by step.
3. You can split a proof goal into cases. For each case, first introduce the case condition, then prove the goal step by step.
4. Proof goals and cases can be recursive. That is, for your convenience, you can split a goal or case into subgoals or subcases.
5. For each proof goal or case, prove the goal in detail.
6. Last, output the conclusion.
